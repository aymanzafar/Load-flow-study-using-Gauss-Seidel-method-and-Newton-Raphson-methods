# Numerical Techniques: Load flow study using Gauss-Seidel method and Newton-Raphson methods

This project focuses on implementing two essential numerical techniques — Gauss-Seidel and Newton-Raphson methods — to perform load flow analysis in power systems. These methods are widely used in electrical engineering for solving systems of nonlinear equations and analyzing voltage profiles across power networks.
